Reference
==

A simple implementation of C++ Standard Library containers. Most of the work can
be referred to:

1. Weiss M.A., *Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++*.
2. Luis Sempe, *User Interface Programming for Games*.
3. SGI, *Standard Template Library*, http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/.
4. 俞勇, *数据结构 思想与实现*.

Physical Organization
==

Though most (if not all) of containers classes are template classes, I still
separate the header and implementation in different files.
